# Soporte Cracks - JS Bot

This project started in 2020 when we must stay at home. 4 years later, I have decided to publish the v1 Source Code, when I started learning JS.

Unfortunately, the project was discontinued and the bot was shutted down forever... But I will always remind it...



# Instructions:
1. Add the token and prefix on ``config.js``.

2. Save the changes and optionally, you can add additional code.

3. Upload the files to [Replit](https://replit.com) or your favorite hosting provider.

4. Once you have finished uploading the code, Run the program and wait until the bot says "Estoy Listo!".

5. Once the bot says that, your bot will be ready Â¡CONGRATULATIONS!!!


Enjoy the first experience of my inspirations, I'll hope this can help someone in a future, as it helped to me.
